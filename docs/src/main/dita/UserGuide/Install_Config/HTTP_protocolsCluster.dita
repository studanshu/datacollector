 <title>Configuring HTTPS for Cluster Pipelines</title>
 <shortdesc>To configure HTTPS when you run cluster pipelines, you can use a self-signed
        certificate. Or, you can generate an SSL certificate for the gateway node and the worker
        nodes. You specify the generated keystore file and keystore password file for the gateway
        and worker nodes in the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        configuration file, <codeph>sdc.properties</codeph>. You can optionally generate a
        truststore file for the gateway and worker nodes.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
            <note>If you run both standalone and cluster pipelines, configure HTTPS for cluster
            pipelines.</note>
