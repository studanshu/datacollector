 <shortdesc>You can access information stored in Hashicorp Vault, such as user credentials, from the
        pipeline.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>To access to Vault data, you must authenticate <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            with Vault. After authentication, you can use expressions in the pipeline that access
            Vault at run time.</p>
        <p>To securely handle Vault information, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
