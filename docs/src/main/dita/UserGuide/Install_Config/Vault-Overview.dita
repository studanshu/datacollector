 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Vault access<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>You can use Vault
            secrets in place of username and password properties, similar properties such as AWS
            access key IDs and secret access keys, and in HTTP headers and bodies when using HTTPS. </p>
        <p>To access to Vault secrets, you must authorize <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            with Vault. After authorization, you can use expressions in the pipeline that access
            Vault at run time.</p>
  <p>To access information stored in Vault, perform the following steps:<ol id="ol_ahx_z41_mw">
                <li>Configure the Vault properties file.</li>
