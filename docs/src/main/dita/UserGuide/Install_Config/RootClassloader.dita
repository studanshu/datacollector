 <conbody>
     <p>The SDC_ROOT_CLASSPATH environment variable defines the path to jar files
            to be added to the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            root classloader. Use the variable for components that must be in the root classloader,
            such as Snappy. Default is <codeph>$SDC_DIST/root-lib/'*'</codeph>.</p>
