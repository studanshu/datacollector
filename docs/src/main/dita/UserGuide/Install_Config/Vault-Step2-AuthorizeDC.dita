    <title>Step 2. Authorize Data Collector in Vault</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Vault<indexterm>authorizing Data Collector</indexterm></indexterm>The <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            Vault integration relies on Vault's App ID auth backend. The App ID auth backend
            requires authorizing a combination of User ID and App ID.</p>
        <p>Each <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            /> has a unique User ID based on the host it resides on. To determine the User ID, run
            the following command:<codeblock>bin/streamsets show-vault-id</codeblock></p>
        <p>After determining the User ID for <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>,
            authorize it in Vault with the appropriate App ID. For more information, see the Vault
            documentation. </p>
        <p>If the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> is
            moved to another host, verify the new User ID and authorize it in Vault.</p>
