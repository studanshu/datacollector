 <title>Viewing JMX Metrics in External Tools</title>
 <shortdesc>You can view the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> JMX
        metrics in external tools. The <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> JMX
        metric names all begin with "sdc.pipeline."</shortdesc>

            JVM metrics use the following naming pattern:</p>
        <codeblock>sdc.pipeline.&lt;pipeline name>.&lt;pipeline revision>.&lt;category: pipeline|stage|custom>.\
[&lt;stage library>_&lt;library revision>].&lt;metric name>.&lt;metric type></codeblock>
        <p>For example, the following is a batch count meter for the first revision of a pipeline
            named Write to Kafka:</p>
        <codeblock>sdc.pipeline.Write to Kafka.0.pipeline.batchCount.meter</codeblock>
        <p>The following metric is a counter for the memory consumed by the File Tail origin in the
            same Write to Kafka
            pipeline:<codeblock>sdc.pipeline.Write to Kafka.0.stage.\
com_streamsets_pipeline_stage_origin_logtail_FileTailDSource_1.memoryConsumed.counter</codeblock></p>
