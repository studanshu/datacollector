 <title>Truststore Files for Cluster Pipelines</title>
 <shortdesc>Optionally, you can generate and use your own truststore file when <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> runs
        cluster pipelines. By default, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses
        the truststore file from the following directory on all nodes in the cluster:
            <codeph>$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts</codeph>.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
     <p>When you generate a truststore file to run cluster pipelines, use the following
         files:</p>
     <dl>
         <dlentry>
             <dt>truststore file and truststore password file on the gateway node</dt>
             <dd>The truststore file on the gateway node stores certificates to trust the
                 identity of the worker nodes. The truststore password file contains the password
                 to open the truststore file. Store both files on the gateway node. Uncomment the
                 following properties and enter the path and name of the files:<ul
                     id="ul_h1s_whp_cw">
                     <li><codeph>https.truststore.path</codeph></li>
                     <li><codeph>https.truststore.password</codeph></li>
                 </ul></dd>
             <dd>Enter an absolute path or a path relative to the <codeph>$SDC_CONF</codeph>
                 directory.</dd>
         </dlentry>
         <dlentry>
             <dt>truststore file and truststore password file on all worker nodes</dt>
             <dd>The truststore file on the worker nodes stores certificates to trust the
                 identity of the gateway node. The truststore password file contains the password
                 to open the truststore file. Store the files in the same absolute location on
                 each worker node. Uncomment the following properties and enter the full path to
                 the files:<ul id="ul_ldk_zhp_cw">
                     <li><codeph>https.cluster.truststore.path</codeph></li>
                     <li><codeph>https.cluster.truststore.password</codeph></li>
                 </ul></dd>
         </dlentry>
     </dl>
