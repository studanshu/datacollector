    <title>Installing from the RPM Package</title>
    <shortdesc>When you install from the RPM package, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses
        the default directories and the default system user and group to start <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> as a
        service. </shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <prereq><p>The default system user and group are named sdc. If an sdc user and an sdc group
                do not exist on the machine, the installation creates the user and group for you and
                assigns them the next available user ID and group ID.</p>
            <note type="tip">To use specific IDs for the sdc user and group, create the user and
                group before installation and specify the IDs that you want to use. For example, if
                youâ€™re installing <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                /> on multiple machines, you might want to create the system user and group before
                installation to ensure that the user ID and group ID are consistent across the
                machines.</note></prereq>
