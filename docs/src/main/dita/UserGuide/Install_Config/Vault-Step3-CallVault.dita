    <title>Step 3. Call Vault from the Pipeline</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Vault<indexterm>functions</indexterm></indexterm>After enabling <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            access Vault and authorizing <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            with Vault, you can use expressions in pipeline and stage properties to access Vault
            secrets.</p>
        <p>The expression language provides Vault functions to return Vault secrets. You can use
            Vault functions in <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/ph-VaultFunctions-Usage"
            /></p>
        <p>You can use the following functions to access Vault secrets:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>vault:read()</dt>
                    <dd>Use to return the value for the Vault path and key that you provide.
                        Typically, you'll use this function to access secrets.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>vault:readWithDelay()</dt>
                    <dd>Use to return the value for the specified Vault path and key with a delay.
                        Use this function to incorporate a delay in the response to allow time for
                        other processes to complete. </dd>
                    <dd>For example, you should use this function when using the Vault AWS secret
                        backend to generate AWS access credentials based on IAM policies. According
                        to Vault documentation, you might need a delay of 10 seconds or more before
                        the credentials can be used successfully.</dd>
                </dlentry>
