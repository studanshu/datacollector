 <title>HTTP Protocols</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure <ph

        HTTP or HTTPS. By default <ph

            provides a self-signed certificate so you can use HTTPS immediately. You can also
            generate a certificate that is self-signed or signed by a certifying authority. Web
            browsers generally issue a warning for self-signed certificates. </p>
        <p>When you configure <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            use HTTPS, you can have <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS or to ignore them.</p>
        <p>You use different properties to configure HTTPS based on whether you run standalone or
            cluster pipelines.</p>
