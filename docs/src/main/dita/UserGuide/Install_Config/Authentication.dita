 <title>Data Collector Authentication</title>
 <shortdesc>StreamSets <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> can
        authenticate user accounts based on files or LDAP. Best practice is to use LDAP if your
        organization has it. By default, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses
        file authentication.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>authentication<indexterm>Data Collector</indexterm></indexterm>When you use file
            authentication, you can use Basic, Digest, or Form. Form is the default file
            authentication type. </p>
        <p>To configure file authentication, edit the authentication realm.properties file for the
            authentication type. For example, to use Form, edit the
                <codeph>form-realm.properties</codeph> file.</p>
        <p>The realm.properties files are in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration directory, <codeph>$SDC_CONF</codeph>.</p>
