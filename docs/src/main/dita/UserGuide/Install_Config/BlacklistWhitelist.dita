 <title>Blacklist and Whitelist for Stage Libraries</title>
 <shortdesc>By default, almost all installed stage libraries are available for use in <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. You
        can use  blacklist and whitelist properties to limit the stage libraries that can be
        used.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>To limit the stage libraries created by StreamSets, use one of the following
            properties:</p>
        <codeblock>system.stagelibs.whitelist
system.stagelibs.blacklist</codeblock>
        <p>To limit stage libraries created by other parties, use one of the following
            properties:<codeblock>user.stagelibs.whitelist
user.stagelibs.blacklist</codeblock></p>
        <note type="warning">Use only the whitelist or blacklist for each set of libraries. Using
            both can cause <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            fail to start.</note>
        <p>The MapR and Apache Solr stage libraries are blacklisted by default. To use one of the
            stage libraries, remove the library that you want to use from the
                <codeph>system.statelibs.blacklist</codeph> property. </p>
