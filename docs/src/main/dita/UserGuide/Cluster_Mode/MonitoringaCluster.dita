    <p><indexterm>cluster mode<indexterm>monitoring</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>metrics and
          alerts<indexterm>for cluster pipelines</indexterm></indexterm>The <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> console
      allows you to monitor each <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> worker. </p>
    <p>After you start a pipeline, the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> console
      displays basic monitoring information for the pipeline and links to each <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> worker.
      For monitoring details for a <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> worker,
      click the worker link. You can then view metrics and alerts for the worker. <note>Metric and
        data alerts are defined for the pipeline, but triggered by individual workers.  When you
        define a metric or data alert, each worker inherits the alert and triggers the alert based
        on the statistics for the worker.</note></p>
