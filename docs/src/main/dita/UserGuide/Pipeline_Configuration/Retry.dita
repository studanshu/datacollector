 <title>Retrying the Pipeline</title>
 <shortdesc>By default, when <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> encounters a
    stage-level error that might cause a standalone pipeline to fail, it retries the pipeline. That
    is, it waits a period of time, and then tries again to run the pipeline.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>pipelines<indexterm>retry attempts upon error</indexterm></indexterm>A stage-level
            error might include a stage not being able to connect to an external system because the
            system or network is down.</p>
  <p>You can define the maximum number of pipeline retries that <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> attempts. </p>
    <p>With the default value, -1, <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> retries
      the pipeline an infinite number of times. This allows the pipeline to continue running as soon
      as any temporary connection or system failures resolve. </p>
    <p>If you want the pipeline to stop after a given number of retries, you can define the maximum
      number of retries to perform.</p>
  <p>The wait time between retries begins at 15 seconds and doubles in length until reaching a
   maximum of 5 minutes. </p>
