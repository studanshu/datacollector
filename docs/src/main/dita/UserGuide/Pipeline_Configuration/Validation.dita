            console saves your changes. Implicit validation lists missing or incomplete

            configured. </dd>
          <dd>Errors found by implicit validation display in the Issues list. An error icons display
            on stages with undefined required properties and on the canvas for pipeline issues. </dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Explicit validation</dt>
          <dd>Explicit validation occurs when you click the Validate icon, request data preview, or
            start the pipeline. Explicit validation becomes available when implicit validation
            passes.</dd>
          <dd>Explicit validation is a semantic validation that checks all configured values for
            validity and verifies whether the pipeline can run as configured. </dd>
          <dd>For example, while implicit validation verifies that you entered a value for a URI,
            explicit validation tests the validity of the URI by connecting to the system. </dd>
          <dd>Errors found by explicit validation display in a list from the validation error
            message. </dd>
