     <dt>I'm writing text data to HDFS. Why are my files all empty? </dt>
     <dd>You might not have the pipeline or Hadoop FS destination configured correctly. </dd>
     <dd>The Hadoop FS destination uses a single field to write text data to HDFS. </dd>
     <dd>The pipeline should collapse all data to a single field. And the Hadoop FS destination must
      be configured to use that field. By default, Hadoop FS uses a field named /text. </dd>
