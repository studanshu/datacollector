     <dt>Why isn't the Directory origin reading all of my files?</dt>
     <dd>Directory reads a set of files based on the configured file name pattern, read order, and
      first file to process. If new files arrive after Directory has passed their position in the
      read order, Directory does not read the files unless you reset the origin.</dd>
     <dd>When using the last-modified timestamp read order, arriving files should have timestamps
      that are later than the files in the directory.</dd>
     <dd>Similarly, when using the lexicographically ascending file name read order, make sure the
      naming convention for the files are lexicographically ascending. For example, filename-1.log,
      filename-2.log, etc., works fine until filename-10.log. If filename-10.log arrives after
      Directory completes reading filename-2.log, Directory does not read filename-10.log since it
      is lexicographically earlier than filename-2.log.</dd>
