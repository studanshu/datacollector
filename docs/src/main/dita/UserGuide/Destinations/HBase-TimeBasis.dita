  <p><indexterm>HBase destination<indexterm>time basis</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>time
                    basis<indexterm>HBase</indexterm></indexterm>You can use the following times as
            the time basis:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Processing Time</dt>
                <dd>When you use processing time as the time basis, the destination uses the <ph

                    /> processing time as the timestamp value. The processing time is calculated
                    once per batch. </dd>
                <dd>To use the processing time as the time basis, use the following expression:
                        <codeph>${time:now()}</codeph>. </dd>

                <dd>When you use the time associated with a record as the time basis, you specify a
                    Date or Datetime field in the record. The destination uses the field value as
                    the timestamp value. </dd>
                <dd>To use a time associated with the record, use an expression that calls a field
                    and resolves to a date or datetime value, such as
                        <codeph>${record:value("/Timestamp")}</codeph>. </dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>System Time</dt>
                <dd> When you leave the Time Basis field empty, the destination uses the timestamp
                    value automatically generated by HBase when the column is written to HBase. </dd>
                <dd>This is the default time basis. </dd>
