 <title>Document IDs and Upserts</title>
 <shortdesc>When appropriate, you can specify the expression that defines the document ID. When you
        do not specify an expression, Elasticsearch generates IDs for each document.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Elasticsearch destination<indexterm>document IDs and
            upserts</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the destination to perform upserts,
            you must define the document ID. </p>
        <p>For example, to perform upserts for documents with IDs based on the EmployeeID field,
            select the <uicontrol>Enable Upsert</uicontrol> property and define the Document ID as
            follows: <codeph>${record:value('/EmployeeID')}</codeph>.</p>
