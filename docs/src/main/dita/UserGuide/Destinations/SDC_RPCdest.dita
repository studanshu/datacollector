          RPC</indexterm></indexterm>You can use SDC RPC pipelines across a single Data Collector
      instance on a single machine, or across a local network or the public internet to a remote
      Data Collector. </p>
    <p>When you configure the SDC RPC destination, you specify the RPC ID and RPC connections to
      use. You can optionally enable encryption to pass data securely and define retry and timeout
      properties.</p>
