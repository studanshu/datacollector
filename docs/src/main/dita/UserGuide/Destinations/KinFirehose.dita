 <title>Kinesis Firehose</title>
    <shortdesc>The Kinesis Firehose destination writes data to an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery
        stream. Firehose automatically delivers the data to the Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon Redshift
        table that you specify in the delivery stream.</shortdesc>

                    Firehose</indexterm></indexterm>To write data to Amazon Kinesis Streams, use the
            Kinesis Producer destination. To write data directly to Amazon S3, use the Amazon S3
            destination. </p>
        <p>When you use the Kinesis Firehose destination to deliver data to Amazon S3, Firehose can
            buffer incoming records into larger file sizes before delivering the data to Amazon S3.
            You configure the buffer size and buffer interval when you create the delivery
            stream.</p>
        <p>When you configure the Kinesis Firehose destination, you specify an existing delivery
            stream to write to, AWS credentials and region, and the data format to use. </p>
