 <title>InfluxDB</title>
 <shortdesc>The InfluxDB destination writes data to an InfluxDB database.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>InfluxDB
                    destination<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>destinations<indexterm>InfluxDB</indexterm></indexterm>When
            you configure the InfluxDB destination, you define connection information, the retention
            policy, and the fields to use as tags on points. If InfluxDB is set up on a cluster, you
            can also define the write consistency level. </p>
        <p>You can use a UDP Source origin to read collectd messages, process the data, and then
            write the messages to InfluxDB in the collectd native format. If you use an origin that
            reads a different data format, you must map the records to points in the InfluxDB
            database.</p>
