 <title>Define the Operation Header Attribute</title>
 <shortdesc>To write to MongoDB, you need to define the MongoDB operation header attribute for each
        record. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Use the following header to define the operation to perform:
            <codeblock>SDC.MONGODB.OPERATION</codeblock></p>
        <p>For each record, set the operation to one of the following values:<ul id="ul_p2k_cf4_4v">
                <li>INSERT</li>
                <li>UPSERT</li>
                <li>DELETE</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>To define the header attribute easily, you might use an Expression Evaluator. Or to
            perform a more complex evaluation before setting the header attribute, you might try a
            scripting processor. </p>
        <p>For example, the following Expression Evaluator sets the MongoDB operation header
            attribute to UPSERT, so the destination system updates or inserts every record:</p>

                operation header attribute based on the value in the _operator field:</p><p>
