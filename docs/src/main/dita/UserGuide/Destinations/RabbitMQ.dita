                    destinations<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the
            destination, you specify the information needed to connect to RabbitMQ client. You also
            define a queue and the bindings to use. You can use multiple bindings to write messages
            to one or more exchanges. You can optionally configure AMQP message properties.</p>
        <p>You can add custom configuration options and define connection credentials as needed.
