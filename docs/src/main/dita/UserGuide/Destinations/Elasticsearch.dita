 <title>Elasticsearch</title>
 <shortdesc>The Elasticsearch destination writes data to an Elasticsearch cluster. It can also write
    to Elasticsearch Found clusters and Shield-enabled clusters. The Elasticsearch destination
    writes each record to Elasticsearch as a document.</shortdesc>

          destination<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>destinations<indexterm>Elasticsearch</indexterm></indexterm>When
      you configure the Elasticsearch destination, you configure the cluster name, node URI, and
      document-related information. </p>
    <p>When the <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
      /> shares the same network as the Elasticsearch cluster, you can enter one or more node URI
      and automatically detect additional Elasticsearch nodes on the cluster. </p>
    <p>You can configure the destination to perform upserts. You can also add advanced Elasticsearch
      properties as needed. </p>
