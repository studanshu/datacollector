   <title>HBase</title>
   <shortdesc>The HBase destination writes data to an HBase cluster. The destination can write data
      to HBase as text, binary data, or JSON strings. You can define the data format for each column
      written to HBase.</shortdesc>

               destination<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>destinations<indexterm>HBase</indexterm></indexterm>When
         you configure the HBase destination, you specify the HBase configuration properties,
         including the ZooKeeper Quorum, parent znode, and table name. You specify the row key for
         the table, and then map fields from the pipeline to HBase columns.</p>
      <p>When necessary, you can enable Kerberos authentication, configure a time basis, and add
         additional HBase configuration properties.</p>
