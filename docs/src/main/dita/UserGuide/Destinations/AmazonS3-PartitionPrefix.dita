 <title>Partition Prefix</title>
 <shortdesc>You can use a partition prefix to organize data by partitions. You can use the partition
        prefix to write to existing partitions or to create new partitions as needed. When a
        partition specified in the partition prefix does not exist, Amazon S3 creates the
        partition.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Amazon S3 destination<indexterm>partition
                prefix</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>partition prefix<indexterm>Amazon S3
                    destination</indexterm></indexterm>You can specify an exact partition name for
            the partition prefix, or you can use an expression that evaluates to a partition name. </p>
        <p>For example, to write data to partitions based on data in the Country field, you can use
            the following expression as the partition prefix:
                <codeph>${record:value('/Country')}</codeph>. </p>
        <p>With this expression, the destination writes records to partitions based on the country
            data in the record, and creates partitions for countries that do not already have a
            partition.</p>
