 <title>Hive Table Generation</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Hive Metastore destination<indexterm>Hive table
            generation</indexterm></indexterm>The Hive Metastore destination can generate Hive
            tables using the following methods:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>With the Stored As Avro clause</dt>
                    <dd>Generates the table with a query that includes the Stored As Avro clause.
                        When using the Stored As Avro clause, the destination does not need to
                        generate an Avro schema for each change in the Hive table. </dd>
                    <dd>This is the default and recommended method for table generation. Enable the
                            <uicontrol>Stored As Avro</uicontrol> property to use this method.</dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Without the Stored As Avro clause</dt>
                    <dd>Generates the table without a Stored As Avro clause in the query. Instead,
                        the destination generates an Avro schema for each Hive table update. The
                        destination uses the following format for the schema name:
                            <codeph>avro_schema_&lt;database>_&lt;table>_&lt;current
                            time>.avsc</codeph>.</dd>
                    <dd>The destination stores the Avro schema in HDFS. You can configure where the
                        destination saves the schemas. You can specify a full path or a path
                        relative to the table directory. By default, the destination saves the
                        schema in a <filepath>.schemas</filepath> sub-folder of the table directory. </dd>
                    <dd>You can configure the destination to generate and store the schemas as a
                        specified HDFS user. <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        /> must be configured as a proxy user in HDFS.</dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
