 <title>Hadoop FS</title>
 <shortdesc>The Hadoop FS destination writes data to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). You
    can write the data to HDFS as flat files or Hadoop sequence files. </shortdesc>

                    FS</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure a Hadoop FS destination, you can
            define a directory template and time basis to determine the output directories that the
            destination creates and the files where records are written. </p>
        <p>As part of the Hive Drift Solution, you can alternatively use record header attributes to
            indicate where to write records. You can also use record header attributes to determine
            the Avro schema to use and when to roll files. </p>
        <p>You can define a file prefix, the data time zone, and properties that define when the
            destination closes a file. You can specify the amount of time that a record can be
            written to its associated directory and what happens to late records.</p>
    <p conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/HDFS_user_props"/>
    <p>You can use Gzip, Bzip2, Snappy, LZ4, and other compression formats to write output files.
