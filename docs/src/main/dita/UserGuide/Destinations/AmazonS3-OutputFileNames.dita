 <title>Output File Names</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Amazon S3 destination<indexterm>output file names</indexterm></indexterm>The
            Amazon S3 destination creates a file for each batch of data written. Output files use
            the following naming convention:
            <codeblock>&lt;prefix>-&lt;UTC timestamp>-&lt;counter></codeblock></p>
        <p>For example: <codeph>sdc-1462405014177-1</codeph>.</p>
        <p>You can configure the file name prefix. The UTC timestamp is the time when the file is
            created, to the millisecond. The counter is used when multiple files are created in the
            same millisecond. </p>
