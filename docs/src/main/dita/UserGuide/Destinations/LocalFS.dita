 <title>Local FS</title>
 <shortdesc>Use the Local FS destination to write records to files in a local file system. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Local FS
                    destination<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>destinations<indexterm>Local
                    FS</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure a Local FS destination, you define
            the output directory template. Local FS creates output directories based on the template
            and the time basis. Local FS writes records to the directories based on the time basis
            as well. </p>
        <p>You can specify the amount of time that a record can be written to its associated
            directory and what happens to late records. </p>
        <p>You can also use record header attributes to perform record-based writes. For more
            information, see <xref href="RecordHeaderAttributes.dita#concept_lmn_gdc_1w"/>.</p>
        <p>You can use Gzip, Bzip2, Snappy, LZ4, and other compression formats to write output
            files. </p>
