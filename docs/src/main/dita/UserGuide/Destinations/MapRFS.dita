 <title>MapR FS </title>
 <shortdesc>The MapR FS destination writes files to MapR FS. You can write the data to MapR as flat
        files or Hadoop sequence files. </shortdesc>

                    FS</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure a MapR FS destination, you define
            the output directory template. The destination creates output directories based on the
            template and the time basis. The destination writes records to the directories based on
            the time basis as well.</p>
        <p>You can specify the amount of time that a record can be written to its associated
            directory and what happens to late records. </p>
        <p>You can use Gzip, Bzip2, Snappy, LZ4, and other compression formats to write output
            files. </p>  <p conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/MapRPrereq"/>
        <draft-comment author="Loretta">These MapR topics are basically copied from Hadoop FS. Make
            sure changes here go there. </draft-comment>
