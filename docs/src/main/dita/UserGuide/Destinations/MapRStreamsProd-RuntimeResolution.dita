 <title>Runtime Topic Resolution</title>
    <shortdesc>MapR Streams Producer can write a record to the topic based on an expression. When
        MapR Streams Producer evaluates a record, it calculates the expression based on record
        values and writes the record to the resulting topic. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>MapR Streams Producer destination<indexterm>runtime topic
                resolution</indexterm></indexterm>When performing runtime topic resolution, MapR
            Streams Producer can write to any topic by default. You can create a white list of
            topics to limit the number of topics the destination attempts to use. When you create a
            white list, any record that resolves to an unlisted topic is sent to the stage for error
            handling. Use a white list when record data might resolve to invalid topic names.</p>
