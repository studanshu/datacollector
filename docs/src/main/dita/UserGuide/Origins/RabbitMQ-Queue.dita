 <shortdesc>RabbitMQ Consumer reads messages from a specified queue. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>RabbitMQ Consumer<indexterm>queue</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the
            origin, you define the queue name and other properties. If a queue of the specified name
            does not exist, RabbitMQ creates the queue based on the properties that you defined. </p>
        <p>If the queue does exist but the properties are incorrect, error messages display when
            trying to connect. </p>
