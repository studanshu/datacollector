 <title>RabbitMQ Consumer</title>
 <shortdesc>RabbitMQ Consumer reads AMQP messages from a single RabbitMQ queue.</shortdesc>

                    Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the origin, you specify the
            information needed to connect to RabbitMQ client. You also define a queue and the
            bindings to use. You can use multiple bindings to read messages from one or more
            exchanges. </p>
        <p>You can configure the origin to generate a single record for each RabbitMQ message. By
            default, if a message includes multiple objects, the origin generates a record for each
            object.</p>
        <p>You can add custom configuration options and define connection credentials as needed. </p>
