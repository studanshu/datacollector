 <title>Hadoop FS</title>
 <shortdesc>The Hadoop FS origin reads data from the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). You can
    read log, JSON, or text data with the Hadoop FS origin. Use this origin only in pipelines
    configured for cluster execution mode.</shortdesc>

          FS</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the Hadoop FS origin, you specify the input
      path and data format for the data to be read. You can configure the origin to read from all
      subdirectories and to generate a single record for records that include multiple objects. </p>
    <p>The origin reads compressed data based on file extension for all Hadoop-supported compression
      codecs.</p>
