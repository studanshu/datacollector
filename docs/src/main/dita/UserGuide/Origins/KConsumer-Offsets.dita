 <title>Initial and Subsequent Offsets</title>
 <shortdesc>When you start a pipeline for the first time, the Kafka Consumer becomes a new consumer
  group for the topic. It reads only incoming data - processing data from all partitions - and
  ignores any existing data in the topic by default. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>offsets<indexterm>for Kafka Consumer</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Kafka
    Consumer origin<indexterm>initial and subsequent offsets</indexterm></indexterm>After the origin
   passes data to destinations, it saves the offset with the ZooKeeper. When you stop and restart
   the pipeline, processing continues based on the offset provided by the ZooKeeper.</p>
  <p>To configure the origin to read all unread data in the topic, you can add the
        <uicontrol>auto.offset.reset</uicontrol> Kafka configuration property. Set the property to
        <uicontrol>smallest</uicontrol> for versions before <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/KafkaSecure"/>. Set it
      to <uicontrol>earliest</uicontrol> for <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/KafkaSecure"/> and
      later.  For more information about auto.offset.reset, see the Apache Kafka documentation. </p>
