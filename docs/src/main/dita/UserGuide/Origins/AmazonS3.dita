 <shortdesc>The Amazon S3 origin reads files stored in Amazon S3. The file names must share a prefix
        pattern and should be fully written.</shortdesc>

                    origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>With the Amazon S3 origin, you
            define the region, bucket, prefix pattern and optional common prefix. These properties
            determine the files that the origin processes. </p>
  <p>After processing a file or upon encountering errors, the origin can keep, archive, or delete
            the file. </p>
  <p>When the pipeline stops, the Amazon S3 origin notes where it stops reading. When the pipeline
   starts again, the origin continues processing from where it stopped by default. You can reset the
   origin to process all requested files. </p>
        <p>You can optionally use a proxy to connect to Amazon S3. </p>
