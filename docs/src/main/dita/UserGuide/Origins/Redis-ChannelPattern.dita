 <title>Channels and Patterns</title>
 <shortdesc>You can specify channels and patterns to define the data that the Redis Consumer origin
        processes.</shortdesc>

                    Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>You can list individual channels and glob-style
            patterns. When you define a pattern, the origin reads from all channels with names that
            match the pattern. For example, the *log* pattern subscribes to any channel with "log"
            in the channel name. </p>
        <p>To avoid processing duplicate messages, do not subscribe to the same channel more than
            once. Redis allows messages to be read more than once by the same client. </p>
