          origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the Omniture origin,
      you specify connection information, the request interval, and the report description. You can
      optionally use a proxy to connect to the origin system. </p>
  <p>The request interval is the amount of time the Omniture origin waits before requesting another
   report. However, if the Omniture API has not yet responded to the previous request, the origin
   waits until it receives a response, and then sends a new request immediately. </p>
    <p>For information about Omniture reports, see the Adobe Marketing Cloud documentation. </p>
