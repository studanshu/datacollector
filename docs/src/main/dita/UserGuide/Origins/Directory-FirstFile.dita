        <title>First File for Processing</title>
        <shortdesc>Configure a first file for processing when you want Directory to ignore one or
                more existing files in the directory.</shortdesc>

                                        pattern<indexterm>for Directory</indexterm></indexterm>When
                        you define a first file to process, Directory starts processing with the
                        specified file and continues based on the read order and file name pattern.
                        When you do not specify a first file, Directory processes all files in the
                        directory that match the file name pattern. </p>
                <p>For example, say Directory reads files based on last-modified timestamp. To
                        ignore all files older than a particular file, use that file name as the
                        first file to process.</p>
                <p>Similarly, say you have Directory reading files based on lexicographically
                        ascending file names, and the file directory includes the following files:
                        web_001.log, web_002.log, web_003.log. </p>
                <p>If you configure web_002.log as the first file, Directory reads web_002.log and
                        continues to web_003.log. It skips web_001.log. </p>
        </conbody>
