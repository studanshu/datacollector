 <title>JMS Consumer</title>
 <shortdesc>The JMS Consumer origin reads data from a Java Messaging Service (JMS). </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>JMS Consumer
                    origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>origins<indexterm>JMS
                    Consumer</indexterm></indexterm>Before you use JMS Consumer, install the drivers
            required for your JMS implementation.</p>
        <p>When you configure a JMS Consumer, you configure the connection information and the queue
            or topic name. You can optionally use JMS credentials and remove control characters. You
            can also define a JMS message selector to specify the messages that the origin reads. By
            default, JMS Consumer reads all messages.</p>
  <p>JMS stores the offset with the JMS server. You cannot use <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            reset the offset.<note>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an alternative
                standard to JMS and any AMQP provider should also support JMS.</note></p>
