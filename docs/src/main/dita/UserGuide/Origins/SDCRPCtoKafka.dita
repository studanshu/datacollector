 <title>SDC RPC to Kafka</title>
 <shortdesc>The SDC RPC to Kafka origin reads data from one or more SDC RPC destinations and writes
        it immediately Kafka. Use the SDC RPC to Kafka origin in an SDC RPC destination pipeline. </shortdesc>

                    RPC to Kafka</indexterm></indexterm>Use the SDC RPC to Kafka origin when you
            have multiple SDC RPC origin pipelines with data that you want to write to Kafka without
            additional processing. </p>
        <p>Like the SDC RPC origin, the SDC RPC to Kafka origin reads data from an SDC RPC
            destination in another pipeline. However, the SDC RPC to Kafka origin is optimized to
            write data from multiple pipelines directly to Kafka. When you use this origin, you
            cannot perform additional processing before writing to Kafka.</p>
        <p>When you configure the SDC RPC to Kafka origin, you define the port that the origin
            listens to for data, the SDC RPC ID, the maximum number of concurrent requests, and
            maximum batch request size. You can optionally use TLS to connect to the SDC RPC
            destinations providing data.</p>
        <p>You also need to configure connection information for Kafka, including the broker URI,
            topic to write to, and maximum message size. You can add Kafka configuration properties
            and enable Kafka security as needed. </p>
