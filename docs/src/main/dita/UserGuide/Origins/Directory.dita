 <title>Directory</title>
 <shortdesc>The Directory origin reads data from files in a directory. The file names must all share
        a file name pattern and be fully written. To read data from an active file that is still
        being written to, use the File Tail origin.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Directory
                    origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>origins<indexterm>Directory</indexterm></indexterm>When
            you configure the Directory origin, you define the directory to use, read order, file
            name pattern, and first file to process. These properties determine the files that the
            origin processes. You can also enable reading compressed files or files in a late
            arriving directory. After processing a file, Directory can keep, archive, or delete the
            file. </p>
        <p>When the pipeline stops, Directory notes where it stops reading. When the pipeline starts
            again, Directory continues processing from where it stopped by default. You can reset
            the origin to process all requested files. </p>
        <p>Directory includes additional header attributes that enable you to include the provenance
            of a record in the record. For more information, see <xref
                href="FilePath_Offset.dita#concept_ljn_2h3_yv"/>. </p>
