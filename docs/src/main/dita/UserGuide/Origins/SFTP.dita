                    Client</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the SFTP/FTP Client origin, you
            specify the URL where the files reside on the remote server and other read properties.
            If the server requires authentication, configure the origin to use login credentials. If
            using the SFTP protocol, you can also configure the origin for strict host checking. </p>
        <p>You can configure the origin to download files to an archive directory if the origin
            encounters errors while reading the files.</p>
