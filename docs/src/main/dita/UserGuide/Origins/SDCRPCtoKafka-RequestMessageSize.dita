    <title>Batch Request Size, Kafka Message Size, and Kafka Configuration</title>
    <shortdesc>Configure the SDC RPC to Kafka maximum batch request size and message size properties
        in relationship to each other and to the Kafka configuration for maximum message
        size.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The <uicontrol>Max Batch Request Size (MB) </uicontrol> property determines the maximum
            size of the batch of data that the origin accepts from each SDC RPC destination. Upon
            receiving a batch of data, the origin immediately writes the data to Kafka.</p>
        <p>To promote peak performance, the origin writes as many records as possible into a single
            Kafka message. The <uicontrol>Max Message Size (KB)</uicontrol> property determines the
            maximum size of the message that it creates. </p>
        <note>The maximum message size specified in the origin must be smaller than the maximum
            message size configured in Kafka. By default, the maximum message size in Kafka -
            currently defined by the message.max.bytes property - is 1 MB.</note>
        <p>For example, say the origin uses the default 100 MB for the maximum batch request size
            and the default 900 KB for the maximum message size, and Kakfa uses the 1 MB default for
            message.max.bytes. </p>
        <p>When the origin requests a batch of data, it receives up to 100 MB of data at a time.
            When the origin writes to Kafka it groups records into as few messages as possible,
            including up to 900 KB of records in each message. Since the message size is less than
            the Kafka 1 MB requirement, the origin successfully writes all messages to Kafka.</p>
        <p>If a record happens to be larger than the 900 KB maximum message size, the origin
            generates an error and does not write it to Kafka. The SDC RPC destination that provided
            the record processes the record based on stage error record handling. <draft-comment
                author="Loretta">Email out to Tucu verifying the above. He mentioned he created
                SDC-3452 after he read this, but can't tell from the bug if this is
                correct.</draft-comment></p>
