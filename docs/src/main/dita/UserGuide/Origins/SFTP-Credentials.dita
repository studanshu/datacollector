                        password. </dd>

                    <dd>The SFTP server requires authentication using a private key file. Store the
                        private key file in a local directory. For the SFTP protocol only.</dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
        <p>If using the SFTP protocol, you can also configure the origin to use strict host
            checking. When enabled, the origin connects to the SFTP server only if the server is
            listed in the known hosts file stored in a local directory. The known hosts file
            contains the host keys for the approved SFTP servers.</p>
