 <title>SDC RPC </title>
 <shortdesc> The SDC RPC origin enables connectivity between two SDC RPC pipelines. The SDC RPC
    origin reads data passed from an SDC RPC destination. Use the SDC RPC origin as part of an SDC
    RPC destination pipeline.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>origins<indexterm>SDC RPC</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>SDC RPC
          origins<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>You can use SDC RPC pipelines across a
      single Data Collector instance on a single machine, or across a local network or the public
      internet to a remote Data Collector. You can configure the origin to use encryption for secure
      connectivity. </p>
    <p>When you configure the SDC RPC origin, you define the port that the origin listens to for
      data. The port number must be specified in one of the RPC connections defined in the SDC RPC
      destination. </p>
    <p>Similarly, the RPC ID in the SDC RPC origin must match the RPC ID used in the SDC RPC
      destination. </p>
