 <title>JDBC Consumer</title>
 <shortdesc>The JDBC Consumer origin uses a JDBC connection to read database data. JDBC Consumer
    returns data as a map with column names and field values. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
    <p><indexterm>origins<indexterm>JDBC Consumer</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>JDBC Consumer
          origin<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure JDBC Consumer, you
      specify connection information, query interval, and custom JDBC configuration properties to
      determine how the origin connects to the database. You configure the query mode, offset
      column, initial offset value, and SQL query to define the data returned by the database.</p>
        <p>You can configure the JDBC Consumer to perform change data capture for databases that
            store the information in a table. You can configure the origin to add JDBC namespace
            header attributes. You can also configure custom properties that your driver requires. </p>
    <p>To use a JDBC version older than 4.0, you can specify the driver class name and define a
            health check query.</p>
