 <title>Cache Size and Evictions</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure the maximum size of the cache. When the cache reaches the specified
        limit, it uses the LRU eviction policy, which removes the least recently used data to allow
        for new entries to be written to the cache. </shortdesc>
