 <title>How should I use Data Collector?</title>
 <shortdesc>Use StreamSets <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> like a pipe
    for a data stream. Throughout your enterprise data topology, you have streams of data that you
    need to move, collect, and process on the way to their destinations. <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> provides the
    crucial connection between hops in the stream. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>To solve your ingest needs, you can use a single <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to run one
      or more pipelines. Or you might install a series of <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s to stream
      data across your enterprise data topology. </p>
