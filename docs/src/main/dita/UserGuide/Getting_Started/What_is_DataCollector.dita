 <title>What is StreamSets Data Collector?</title>
 <shortdesc>StreamSets <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> is a
    lightweight, powerful engine that streams data in real time. Use <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to route and
    process data in your data streams. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Data Collector<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>To define the flow of
      data for <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
      />, you configure a <term>pipeline</term>. A pipeline consists of stages that represent the
      origin and destination of the pipeline, and any additional processing that you want to
      perform. After you configure the pipeline, you click Start and <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> goes to
      work. </p>
  <p><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> processes
      data when it arrives at the origin and waits quietly when not needed. You can view real-time
      statistics about your data, inspect data as it passes through the pipeline, or take a close
      look at a snapshot of data. </p>
