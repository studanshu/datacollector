 <title>Field Hasher</title>
 <shortdesc>The Field Hasher uses an algorithm to encode data. Use Field Hasher to encode
        highly-sensitive data. For example, you might use Field Hasher to encode social security or
        credit card numbers.</shortdesc>

                    Hasher</indexterm></indexterm>Field Hasher provides several methods to enable
            hashing individual fields or the entire record. You can hash any field that can be
            converted to a string. The resulting hash is a string value. </p>
        <p>Field Hasher uses MD5, SHA1, SHA2, or MurmurHash3 128 to hash field values. </p>
