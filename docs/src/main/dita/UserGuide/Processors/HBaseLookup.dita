 <title>HBase Lookup</title>
    <shortdesc>The HBase Lookup processor performs key-value lookups in HBase and passes the lookup
        values to fields. Use the HBase Lookup to enrich records with additional data.</shortdesc>

                    Lookup</indexterm></indexterm>For example, you can configure the processor to
            use a department_ID field as the key to look up department name values in HBase, and
            pass the values to a new department_name output field.</p>
        <p>When you configure the HBase Lookup processor, you specify whether the processor performs
            a bulk lookup of all keys in a batch, or performs an individual lookup of each key in a
            record. You define the key to look up in HBase, and specify the output field to write
            the lookup values to. </p>
        <p>You can configure the processor to locally cache the key-value pairs to improve
            performance.</p>
        <p>You also specify the HBase configuration properties, including the ZooKeeper Quorum,
            parent znode, and table name. When necessary, you can enable Kerberos authentication and
            add additional HBase configuration properties.</p>
