 <title>JavaScript Evaluator</title>
 <shortdesc>The JavaScript Evaluator processes data based on JavaScript code. Use the JavaScript
        processor to use JavaScript code to perform custom processing.</shortdesc>

                    Evaluator</indexterm></indexterm>The JavaScript Evaluator can process data one
            record at a time or one batch at a time. </p>
  <p>When you use a JavaScript Evaluator in a pipeline, the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            passes a batch of data to the processor and converts the data to a scripting-friendly
            data structure for processing.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript Evaluator supports the following versions of Java:<ul id="ul_xyk_lp2_qr">
                <li>Java 7 - Supports ECMAScript 5 and partially supports JavaScript 1.8. Runs on
                    the Rhino 1.7R3 JavaScript engine.</li>
                <li>Java 8u40 and above - Supports ECMAScript 5.1. Runs on the Nashorn JavaScript
                    engine.</li>
            </ul><note>Some Java 8 JavaScript functionality is not available in Java 7 JavaScript.
                To ensure the JavaScript Evaluator performs as expected, use the same version of
                Java in development and production.</note></p>
