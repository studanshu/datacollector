 <title>Field Splitter</title>
 <shortdesc>The Field Splitter splits string data based on a separator character and passes the
  separated data to new fields. Use the Field Splitter to split complex string values into logical
  components. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Field Splitter
     processor<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>processors<indexterm>Field
     Splitter</indexterm></indexterm>For example, if a field contains an error code and error
   message separated by a comma, you can use the comma to separate the code and message into
   different fields.</p>
  <p>When a field includes additional data and separator characters, the Field Splitter includes the
   remaining data in the last split field. </p>
  <p>If a field cannot be split as requested, the Field Splitter can pass the record split as much
   as possible, discard the record, pass the error to the pipeline for error handling, or stop the
   pipeline. </p>
  <p>You can keep data from the original field in the record or discard it. </p>
  <section>
   <title>Example</title>
   <p>A Field Splitter uses a comma to split data into two fields and to discard records that cannot
    be split as requested. When it encounters a single comma, it passes the data before the comma to
    the ErrorCode field and the data after the comma to the ErrorMessage field. </p>
   <p>When this Field Splitter processes the following records:<simpletable frame="none"
     relcolwidth="1.0*" id="simpletable_dqy_dd3_yq">
     <strow>
      <stentry>
       <codeblock>GM-302,information that you might need
ME-3042,message about this error,"additional information from the server"
IMD-03234</codeblock>
      </stentry>
     </strow>
    </simpletable></p>
   <p>The Field Splitter produces the following records:<simpletable frame="none"
     relcolwidth="1.0* 4.1*" id="simpletable_kxh_fd3_yq">
     <strow>
      <stentry>
       <codeblock><uicontrol>ErrorCode</uicontrol>
GM-302 
ME-3042</codeblock>
      </stentry>
      <stentry>
       <codeblock><uicontrol>Message</uicontrol>
information that you might need
message about this error,"additional information from the server"</codeblock>
      </stentry>
     </strow>
    </simpletable></p>
   <p>The Field Splitter discards IMD-03234 because the record does not include enough data to be
    split, and the processor is configured to discard such records. </p>
