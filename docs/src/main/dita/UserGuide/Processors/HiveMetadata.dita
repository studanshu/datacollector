 <title>Hive Metadata</title>
 <shortdesc>The Hive Metadata processor works with the Hive Metastore destination and Hadoop FS
        destination as part of the Hive Drift Solution. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>processors<indexterm>Hive Metadata</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Hive
                Metadata processor<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Use the Hive Metadata
            processor for records to be written to HDFS when you want the Hive Metastore destination
            to create and update tables as needed. The processor also generates record header
            attributes that the Hadoop FS destination can use to process the data.</p>
  <p>When you configure the Hive Metadata processor, you define the connection information for Hive
            and the expressions that define the database, table, and partitions that the records
            require. </p>
        <p>You define the location of the Hive and Hadoop configuration files and optionally specify
            additional required properties. You can also configure advanced options, such as the
            maximum cache size, time basis, and decimal precision and scale expressions.</p>
