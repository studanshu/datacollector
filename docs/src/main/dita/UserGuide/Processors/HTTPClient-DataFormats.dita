                    processor</indexterm></indexterm>The processor treats the response as the
            specified data format and processes data differently based on the data format:</p>
  <p>
            <dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>JSON</dt>
                    <dd>Writes a parsed JSON response to the specified field. </dd>
                    <dd>When an object exceeds the maximum object length defined for the origin, the
                        processor processes the object based on the error handling configured for
                        the stage. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Text</dt>
                    <dd>Writes the response as a string to the specified field. </dd>
                    <dd>When a line exceeds the maximum line length, the processor truncates the
                        line. The processor adds a boolean field named Truncated to indicate if the
                        line was truncated. </dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>XML</dt>
                    <dd>Writes the XML response to the specified field. </dd>
                    <dd>When specified, the processor uses the delimiter element to nest additional
                        elements in the field. </dd>
                    <dd>When a record exceeds the maximum record length, the processor skips the
                        record and continues processing with the next record. It sends the skipped
                        record to the pipeline for error handling. </dd>
