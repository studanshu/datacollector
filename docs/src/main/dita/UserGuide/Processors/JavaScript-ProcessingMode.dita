 <title>Processing Mode</title>
 <shortdesc>You can choose the processing mode to use with the JavaScript Evaluator. You can use the
        same script in each processing mode. However, you should include error handling in the
        script before you run in batch mode.</shortdesc>

                    <dd>The processor calls the script for each batch. The processor passes the
                        batch to the script as an array and processes the batch at one time. </dd>
                    <dd>Include error handling logic in the script. Without error handling logic, a
                        single error record sends the entire batch to the processor for error
                        handling. The processor handles error records based on the On Record Error
                        property.</dd>

                        time.</dd>
