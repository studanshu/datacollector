 <title>Base64 Field Encoder</title>
 <shortdesc>The Base64 Field Encoder encodes binary data using Base64. Use the processor to encode
        binary data that must be sent over channels that expect ASCII data.</shortdesc>

                    processor<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>For example, you can use
            Base64 encoding to embed image data directly in HTML source code. When you encode the
            data, you prevent characters such as “&lt;” and “>” from being interpreted as tags.</p>
        <p>When you configure Base64 Field Encoder, you specify the byte array field to encode and
            the target byte array field to pass the encoded value to. You can also specify that the
            processor encode the data so that it can be safely sent in a URL.</p>
