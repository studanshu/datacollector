 <title>Renaming Sets of Fields</title>
 <shortdesc>You can use regular expressions, or <term>regex</term>, to rename sets of fields. You
        can use regex to define the set of source fields to rename. You can also use regex to define
        the target field names. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>For example, say you want to remove an OPS prefix from a set of fields. You can do this by
            using the following expression to define the source fields to change:
            <codeblock>OPS(.*)</codeblock></p>
        <p>Then use the following expression to remove the OPS prefix:<codeblock>$1</codeblock></p>
        <p>Or, to remove special characters from field names, you can use the following expression
            for the source field
            names:<codeblock>/([A-Z a-z]*)[^a-z A-Z 0-9]([A-Z a-z 0-9]*)</codeblock></p>
        <p>Then use the following expression for target field
            names:<codeblock>/$1_invalid_character_removed_$2</codeblock></p>
 </conbody>
