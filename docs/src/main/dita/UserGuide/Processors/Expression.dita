 <title>Expression Evaluator</title>
 <shortdesc>The Expression Evaluator performs calculations and writes the results to new or existing
        fields. You can also use the Expression Evaluator to add or modify record header attributes. </shortdesc>

                    processor<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>To create an expression, you
            define the name of the field or header attribute to receive the results of the
            expression. And then, use the expression language to define the expression to use.</p>
  <p>You can use pipeline constants in expressions. Define a pipeline constant when you have a
            constant value that you use in more than one expression in the pipeline or that you want
            to change easily. </p>
        <p>You can also use the time:now() function to include the <ph
