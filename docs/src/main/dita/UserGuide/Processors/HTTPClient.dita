 <title>HTTP Client</title>
 <shortdesc>The HTTP Client processor sends requests to an HTTP resource URL and writes the results
        to a field in the record. You can use the HTTP Client processor to perform a range of
        standard requests or you can use an expression to determine the request for each
        record.</shortdesc>

            resource URL, header attributes, and method to use. For some methods, you can specify
            additional request information. </p>
        <p>You can configure the timeout, maximum number of parallel requests, and authentication
            type. You can optionally use a truststore and keystore, and proxy.</p>
