 <title>Output Streams</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>The Hive Metadata processor includes two output streams:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Data output stream</dt>
                <dd>Passes records downstream to the Hadoop FS destination. You can add additional
                    stages between the Hive Metadata processor and the Hadoop FS destination when
                    needed, but only the Hadoop FS destination can use the generated record header
                    attributes to write records to HDFS. </dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Metadata output stream</dt>
                <dd>Passes the metadata records downstream to the Hive Metastore destination. The
                    metadata output stream does not pass record data of any kind. <p>You can add
                        additional stages between the Hive Metadata processor and the Hive Metastore
                        destination when needed, but only the Hive Metastore destination can use the
                        metadata record to update the Hive Metastore. </p></dd>
            </dlentry>
        </dl>
        <p>The following image shows the Hive Metadata processor output streams:</p>
