 <title>Processing List-Map Data</title>
 <shortdesc>In scripts that process list-map data, treat the data as maps. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Groovy Evaluator processor<indexterm>processing list-map
    data</indexterm></indexterm>List-Map is a <ph
      conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> data type that
    allows you to use standard record functions to work with delimited data. When an origin reads
    delimited data, it generates List-Map fields by default. </p>
  <p>The Groovy Evaluator reads and passes list-map data. But to process data in a List-Map field,
   treat the field as a Map in the script.</p>
