        <p><indexterm>Hive Metadata processor<indexterm>Kerberos
                authentication</indexterm></indexterm>You can use Kerberos authentication to connect
            to HDFS. When you use Kerberos authentication, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            uses the Kerberos principal and keytab to connect to HiveServer2. </p>
        <p>The Kerberos principal and keytab are defined in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration file,<codeph> $SDC_CONF/sdc.properties</codeph>. To use Kerberos
            authentication, configure all Kerberos properties in the<ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration file, and include the Kerberos principal in the HiveServer2 JDBC URL.</p>
