                    Renamer</indexterm></indexterm>You can configure the behavior when a source
            field does not exist, when a target field with a matching name already exists, and when
            a source field matches multiple source field expressions. </p>
        <p>Fields that are not renamed or overwritten pass to the next stage.</p>
