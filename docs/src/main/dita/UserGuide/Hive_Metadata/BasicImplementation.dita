    <title>Basic Implementation</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Hive Drift Solution<indexterm>basic implementation</indexterm></indexterm>You
            can use the Hive Metadata processor, Hive Metastore destination, and Hadoop FS
            destination in any pipeline where the logic is appropriate.</p>
        <p>A basic implementation of the Hive Drift Solution includes the origin of your choice, and
            the Hive Metadata processor writing to the Hadoop FS and Hive Metastore destinations, as
            follows:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/HiveMeta-Pipeline.png" id="image_ys3_ztg_2w" scale="70"/></p>
        <p>The Hive Metadata processor passes records through the first output stream - the data
            stream. Connect the data stream to the Hadoop FS destination to write data to HDFS using
            record header attributes. </p>
        <p>The Hive Metadata processor passes the metadata record through the second output stream -
            the metadata output stream. Connect the Hive Metastore destination to the metadata
            output stream to enable the destination to create and update Hive tables. The metadata
            output stream contains no record data. </p>
    </conbody>
