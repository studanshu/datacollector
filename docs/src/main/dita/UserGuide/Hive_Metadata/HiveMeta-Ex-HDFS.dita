 <title>The Hadoop FS Destination</title>
 <shortdesc>Hadoop FS is the destination that writes data to HDFS using record header attributes.
        Record header attributes contain the write details that the Hive Metadata processor
        generates and adds to records. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>So you connect the Hadoop FS destination to the data output stream of the processor. When you
            configure the destination, instead of configuring a directory template, you configure
            the destination to use the directory in the record header. Instead of configuring an
            Avro schema, you indicate you have a schema in the record header. And you configure the
            destination to roll files when it sees a "roll" attribute in the record header. </p>
        <p>The Output Files tab of the destination might look something like this:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/HiveMeta-Ex-HDFS.png" id="image_sbv_xrn_fw" scale="70"/></p>
        <p>And the Avro tab looks like this:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/HiveMeta-Ex-HDFS-Avro.png" id="image_wzp_1sn_fw" scale="70"
            /></p>
        <p>With this setup, the destination uses the information in record header attributes to
            write data to HDFS. It writes each record to the directory in the targetDirectory header
            attribute, using the Avro schema in the avroSchema header attribute. And it rolls a file
            when it spots the roll attribute in a record header. </p>
        <p>Note that the destination can also use Max Records in File and Max Files Size to
            determine when to roll files.</p>
