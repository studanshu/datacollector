 <title>Stage-Related Errors</title>

  <p>To view stage-related errors, select the stage from the stage list. Or, click the stage in the
   canvas. The <uicontrol>Errors</uicontrol> tab of the <wintitle>Monitor</wintitle> panel displays

     <dd>
      <p>Displays a sample of error records with related error messages, as well as the count and an
       error histogram.</p>
     </dd>
     <dd>You can expand and review the data in each error record. If the error was produced by an
            exception, you can click <uicontrol>View Stack Trace</uicontrol> to view the full stack
            trace. The number of error records saved in memory is defined in the <ph

    <dlentry>
     <dt>Stage Errors</dt>
     <dd>Displays a list of stage errors as well as the count and an error histogram. Stage errors
      are operational errors, such as an origin being unable to create a record because of invalid
      source data.</dd>
