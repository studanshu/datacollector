    <title>Editing Preview Data</title>
    <shortdesc>You can edit preview data to view how a stage or group of stages processes the
        changed data. Edit preview data to test for data conditions that might not appear in the
        preview data set.</shortdesc>

        <context>
            <p><indexterm>data preview<indexterm>editing data</indexterm></indexterm>For example,
                when the stage filters integer data based on an expression, you might change the
                input data to test positive and negative integer values, as well as zero. </p>
            <p>You can edit preview data in the following locations: <ul

                </ul></p>
            <p>When you edit preview data, you can pass the changed data through the pipeline, or
                you can revert your changes to return to the original data.</p>
