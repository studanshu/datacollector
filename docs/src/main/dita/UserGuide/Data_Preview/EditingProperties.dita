    <title>Editing Properties</title>
    <shortdesc>In data preview, you can edit stage properties to see how the changes affect preview
        data. For example, you might edit the expression in an Expression Evaluator to see how the
        expression alters data. </shortdesc>

                edit properties, you can test the change with the existing preview data or you can
                refresh the preview data. </p>
            <p>When changing properties in the origin, refresh the preview data to test your
                changes. Refreshing the preview data allows the <ph

                cached data.<note>Unlike changes to data, you cannot automatically revert property
