 <title>Metric Conditions</title>
 <shortdesc>When you configure a metric rule, you configure the condition that defines the threshold
        at which the metric rule triggers an alert. Use the expression language to configure the
        condition. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>The expression language provides the following functions for creating metric rule
            conditions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>value()</dt>
                <dd>Returns the value of the current metric selected in the metric rule. Use in
                    conditions for any type of metric rule.<p>For example, the default rule for the
                        Pipeline Batch Error Records Counter metric includes the following
                        condition:<codeblock>${value() > 100}</codeblock></p><p>The alert is
                        tiggered when the pipeline encounters more than 100 error records.</p></dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>time.now()</dt>
                <dd>Returns the current time of the Data Collector machine as a java.util.Date
                    object. Use in conditions for gauge metric rules.<p>For example, the default
                        rule for the Runtime Statistics Gauge metric that checks whether the
                        pipeline is idle includes the following
                        condition:<codeblock>${time:now() - value() > 120000}</codeblock></p><p>The
                        alert is triggered when the current time is greater than the time of the
                        last received record by 120,000 milliseconds.</p></dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>jvm:maxMemoryMB()</dt>
                <dd>Returns the Java heap size allocated to <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> in MB. Use in conditions for counter metric rules.<p>For example, the default
                        rule for the Pipeline Memory Consumption Counter metric includes the
                        following
                        condition:<codeblock>${value() > (jvm:maxMemoryMB() * 0.65)}</codeblock></p><p>The
                        alert is triggered when the pipeline uses 65% of the Java heap size
                        allocated to <ph
                            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                        />.</p></dd>
