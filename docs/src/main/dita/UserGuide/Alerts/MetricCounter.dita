            about the Stage Heap Memory Usage statistics displayed in Monitor mode for the pipeline

        <p>The counter metric type includes the following metric IDs:<ul id="ul_lqs_4wf_qv">
                <li>Pipeline Memory Consumption Counter (MB) - Amount of memory being consumed by
                    the pipeline.</li>
                <li>&lt;stage_name> Heap Memory Usage Counter (MB) - Amount of memory being consumed
                    by the named stage.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>For either of the selected metric IDs, you can configure the alert to trigger on the
            count metric element.</p>
        <p>For example, you can configure a counter metric rule that triggers an alert when a stage
            uses 65% of the Java heap size allocated to <ph
