  <p><indexterm>tutorial<indexterm>prerequisites</indexterm></indexterm>Before you start this
      tutorial, you'll need to do a few things:</p>
    <p>
      <ol id="ol_dtv_bzs_zs">
        <li>Download sample data. <p>You can download sample data from the following location:
            </p><draft-comment author="Loretta">verify the link</draft-comment><p><xref
              href="https://www.streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/sample_data/tutorial/nyc_taxi_data.csv"
              format="html" scope="external">
              https://www.streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/sample_data/tutorial/nyc_taxi_data.csv</xref></p></li>
        <li>Create directories local to the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            />.<p>Let's use the same root directory for the origin, destination, and error files as
            follows:<codeblock>/&lt;base directory>/tutorial/origin
/&lt;base directory>/tutorial/destination
/&lt;base directory>/tutorial/error</codeblock>Make
            sure the user who started the <ph
              conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> has
            read and write permission for the directories. </p></li>
        <li>Save the sample data in the origin directory.</li>
        <li>Make sure the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> is
          installed and running. </li>
        <li>To create and run the pipeline, you should have a <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> login
          with the admin role or both the creator and manager roles. <p>If you haven't set up custom
            user accounts, you can use the admin account shipped with the <ph
              conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>. The
            default login is: <codeph>admin</codeph> / <codeph>admin</codeph>. </p></li>
