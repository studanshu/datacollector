    <title>Run the Basic Pipeline</title>
    <shortdesc>Now that the basic pipeline is complete, you can start it by clicking the
            <uicontrol>Start</uicontrol> icon: <image
            href="../Graphics/icon_ConfigStartPipeline.png" id="image_lgp_rxp_ts" scale="75"
        />.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>The console enters Monitor mode and shows summary statistics in the Monitor panel.
            At some point as the pipeline runs, the data alert triggers. A message displays and the
            location of the triggered data alert turns red:<p><image
                    href="../Graphics/Tutorial-RunPipeline.png" id="image_gc3_vyr_ps" scale="55"
                /></p><p>You can close the message and explore the information available in the
                Monitor panel.</p><p>Note that when you select an unused part of the canvas, the
                Monitor panel displays monitoring information for the entire pipeline. When you
                select a stage, it displays information for the stage. </p><p>The Jython Evaluator
                shows 40 error records. Click the error records number to see the list of cached
                error records and related error messages. </p><p>You can also select the red Data
                Inspection icon to view information about the data alert and view the error records
                associated with the data alert.</p><p>To continue with the extended tutorial, stop
                the pipeline. </p><p>If you like, you can use data preview to step through the
                pipeline to review how each stage processes the data. But if you hang in there, you
                can do it with us in the extended tutorial. </p></context>
