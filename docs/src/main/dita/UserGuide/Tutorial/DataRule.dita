    <title>Create a Data Rule and Alert</title>
    <shortdesc>Now before we run the basic pipeline, let's add a data rule and alert. Data rules are
        user-defined rules used to inspect data moving between two stages. They are a powerful way
        to look for outliers and anomalous data. </shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Data rules and alerts require a detailed understanding of the data passing through
                the pipeline. For more general pipeline monitoring information, you can use metric
                rules and alerts.</p>
            <p>The script in the Jython Evaluator creates error records for credit card transactions
                without credit card numbers. We can create a data rule and alert to let us know when
                the record count reaches a specified threshold. </p>
            <p>We'll use an expression with the record:value() function to identify when the credit
                card number field, <codeph>/credit_card</codeph>, is null. The function returns the
                data in the specified field. </p>

                        value might be appropriate, but we'll use these numbers for the purposes of
                        the tutorial.</note>
