    <title>Mask Credit Card Numbers</title>
    <shortdesc> Now let's prevent sensitive information from reaching internal databases by using a
        Field Masker to mask the credit card numbers. </shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>The Field Masker provides fixed and variable-length masks to mask all data in a
                field. To reveal specified positions in the data, you can use custom mask. To reveal
                a group of positions within the data, you can use a regular expression mask to
                define the structure of the data and then reveal one or more groups.</p>
            <p>For the credit card numbers, we'll use the following regular expression to mask all
                but the last four digits:<codeblock>(.*)([0-9]{4})</codeblock></p>
            <p>The regular expression defines two groups so we can reveal the second group.</p>
