    <title>Route Data with the Stream Selector</title>
    <shortdesc>To route data to different streams for processing, we use the Stream Selector
        processor.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context><p>The Stream Selector routes data to different streams based on user-defined
                conditions. Any data not captured by a user-defined condition routes to the default
                stream.</p><p>We'll route credit card transactions to a credit card stream for
                processing. All other transactions will go to the default stream.</p><p>We'll also
                define a required field to drop records with no payment type. When you define a
                required field, a record must include data for the specified field to enter the
                stage. Records that don't include data in required fields are sent to the pipeline
                for error handling. If you configured the pipeline to write to file, that's where
                error records go. </p>To represent data in a field, we use the
                <codeph>record:value</codeph> function. This returns field values associated with
            the field.<p>To capture records with credit card payments, use the following condition:
                <codeblock>${record:value('/payment_type') == 'CRD'}</codeblock></p><p>Note that we
                enclose expressions in a dollar sign and curly brackets. You can use single or
                double quotation marks around strings. For more information about the expression
                language, see <xref
                    href="../Expression_Language/ExpressionLanguage_overview.dita#concept_p54_4kl_vq"
