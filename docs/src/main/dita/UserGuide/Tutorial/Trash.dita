    <title>Write to Trash</title>
    <shortdesc>To wrap up the extended tutorial, let's use the Trash destination as a temporary
        placeholder.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>The Trash destination deletes any records that pass to it. This allows you to test a
                pipeline without writing data to a production system. </p>
            <p>If you prefer, you can use the Hadoop FS destination to write to file as we did
                earlier in the tutorial, or you can use another destination to write to a
                development destination system available to you.</p>
            <p>The Trash destination requires no configuration, so just add it to the canvas and
                connect the Expression Evaluator to it: </p>
