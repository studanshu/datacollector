 <title>Calling a Runtime Property</title>
 <shortdesc>Use the <codeph>runtime:conf</codeph> function to call a runtime property. You can use
        runtime properties to represent any stage or pipeline property that allows the use of the
        expression language. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>runtime properties<indexterm>calling from a pipeline</indexterm></indexterm>To call
            a runtime property, use the following syntax:
            <codeblock>runtime:conf('&lt;property name>')</codeblock></p>
    <note>If you defined the runtime properties in the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
      configuration file, enter just <codeph>&lt;property name></codeph> and not <codeph>runtime.conf_&lt;property name></codeph>.</note>
  <p>For example, to use the HDFSDirTemplate runtime property for the Hadoop FS destination, enter
      the following syntax for the Directory Template
      property:<codeblock>${runtime:conf('HDFSDirTemplate')}</codeblock></p>
  <p>You can use a runtime property to represent a part of a property. For example, you could use a
   RootDir runtime property and append the rest of the directory in the property as
   follows:<codeblock>${runtime:conf('RootDir')}/logfiles</codeblock></p>
 </conbody>
