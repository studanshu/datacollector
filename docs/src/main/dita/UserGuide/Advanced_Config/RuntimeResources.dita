 <title>Runtime Resources</title>
 <shortdesc>Similar to runtime properties, runtime resources are values that you define in a file
        local to the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> and
        call from within a pipeline. But with runtime resources, you can restrict the permissions
        for the files to secure sensitive information. Use runtime resources to load sensitive
        information from files at runtime.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>runtime resources<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>You can use runtime
      resources for any pipeline property that allows the use of the expression language. You can,
      for example, use runtime resources to represent user names and passwords, or OAuth
      authentication information. </p>
  <p>To implement runtime resources, perform the following steps: <ol id="ol_jzr_4sm_2s">
    <li>Define each runtime resource. </li>
    <li>Use an expression in the pipeline to call a runtime resource.</li>
   </ol></p>
